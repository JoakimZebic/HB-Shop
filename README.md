Angular project for college

Static web shop that renders products from .json file

## About

• Designed and coded by me in *only 2 days*.

(LOL , I know, I am responsible student xD)


• Supports English and Serbian language


• Supports Light and Dark theme


• Fully responsive

## Theming

In this project I tested my NEW design system for Angular + Angular Material that uses CSS Variables for dynamic themes.


It supports (some sort of) "typechecking" and "autocomplete" using SASS @function and lists.

When using CSS variables instead of SASS variables we lose the ability to use SASS 'rgba', 'hsla', 'darken()', 'lighten()',... functions which require SASS color type.
This system has new functions that fix it. 

I have to mention that initial setup of variables is a bit cumbersome, but once you set it up it is worth it ( for me at least :D ).
