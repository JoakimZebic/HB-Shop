Angular project for college

Static web shop that renders products from .json file

## About

• Designed and coded by me in *only 2 days*.

(LOL , I know, I am responsible student xD)


• Supports English and Serbian language


• Supports Light and Dark theme


• Fully responsive

## Pages

For now there are only 4 pages:

* Welcome page
* Shop page
* Cart page
* 404 page

## Theming

In this project I tested my NEW design system for Angular + Angular Material that uses CSS Variables for dynamic themes.


It supports (some sort of) "typechecking" and "autocomplete" using SASS @function and lists.

When using CSS variables instead of SASS variables we lose the ability to use SASS 'rgba()', 'hsla()', 'darken()', 'lighten()' functions which require SASS color type.
This system has new functions that fix it.
