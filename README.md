Angular project for college

Static web shop that renders products from .json file

## About

• Designed and coded by me in *only 2 days*.

(LOL , I know, I am responsible student xD)


• Supports English and Serbian language


• Supports Light and Dark theme


• Fully responsive

## Theming

In this project I tested my NEW design system for Angular + Angular Material that uses CSS Variables for dynamic themes.
It supports (some sort of) "typechecking" and "autocomplete" using SASS @function and lists.
